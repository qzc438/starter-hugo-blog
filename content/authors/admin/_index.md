I have recently completed my honours degree in a Master of Business Information Systems. Prior to my masterâ€™s, I have had five years of hands-on commercial experience while working for two different organisations. These roles allowed me to gain valuable experience in developing websites and mobile applications in both front and back end using several programming languages. Most recently during my studies, I have been teaching a master course FIT5042 Enterprise Application Development for the Web at Monash University. I also have excellent communication skills, great attention to detail, particularly good problem-solving skills and have shown that I take direction very well. My minor thesis focused on tackling key challenges of sharing and reusing of deep learning models across different platforms. I proposed and developed an ontology and incorporated it into an online platform for storing and querying the deep learning models.
